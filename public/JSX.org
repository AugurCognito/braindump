* [[http://facebook.github.io/jsx/][JSX]]
It is a way to write HTML inside the JavaScript. To use it inside a HTML file we use Babel, another library, and we use it using =target= attribute of =script= tag of where we want JSX to add.
#+begin_src html
<script type="text/babel">
// my app's code
</script>
#+end_src
This will make browser ignore that =script= tag as invalid and babel can use parse that into browser readable.\\
** Self-Closing tags

require you ending them with =\= for them to work, for example to write =<br>=, you need to write =<br\>=.
