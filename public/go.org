Package are a way to group go files together.
** LSP
Not exactly realted but if you are trying to use LSP with go, you need to install the =gopls= package. If you editor does set it up for you then great but if not then you can do it manually.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
go get golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
#+END_SRC
and add the following to your =.bashrc= or =.zshrc= file
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
export GO111MODULE=on
export GOPATH={your go path}
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
#+END_SRC
Now you should be able to use LSP with go.
