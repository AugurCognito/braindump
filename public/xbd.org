well first of all good luck. As of writing I am on Ubuntu 20.4 and using KDE (with wayland). Apparently =xmodmap= does not work with wayland. I could not find the most correct way(which is think should work using =.config=).
Special thanks to [[https://www.codejam.info/2022/04/xmodmaprc-wayland.html][this migration blog by Val]] and [[https://medium.com/@damko/a-simple-humble-but-comprehensive-guide-to-xkb-for-linux-6f1ad5e13450][this xkb guide by Damiano Venturin]]. Saved me a lot of time.

So what I ended up doing was:
1. Whatever was said in the blog by Val. Adding =.lst= to the =evdev= file. But still it did not work.
2. Ended up adding keybinds in the =usr/share/x11/xkb/symbols/us= file. This is the file which contains the keybinds for the US keyboard. I added the following lines to the file.
   #+begin_src
   default partial alphanumeric_keys modifier_keys
   xkb_symbols "basic" {
    name[Group1]= "English (US)";
    key <TLDE> {	[     Control_L	]	};
    .
    .
    .
    key <LCTL> { [ quoteleft, asciitilde ] };
    key <RCTL> { [ Control_R ] };
    };
    #+end_src
